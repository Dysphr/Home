<h1>help me</h1>
<p>please talk to me</p>
<p>if you see this then you've at least gone to the effort of opening the link so please talk to me. Anything'll do since no one voluntarily talks to me. I always have to initiate conversation and it's depressing.</p>
<br>
<p>The old site <u>will</u> return soon. <br>Incase you want it: <a href="indexoriginal.html">[■□]</a></p>
<p>As of Wednesday the 28th of May (28/05/5), I will be modifying the website extremely as to better organise and future-proof it. <br>These changes will not be visible on this repository.</p>
