why are you here

the sombre look of the soft room is as shrill as the floor moving from my eyes, quietly rippling away into void

i ask again

the walls breathe loudly the sound of silence as the soft room echos my cries through the deafening hum ever flowing through my ears

why are you here

the lonely mirror reflects back an empty chair on which i perch whilst my skin pulses from solidarity

i'm going crazy

hope, joy & freedom speaks from above whilst the fluorescent lamp reaches out grasping violently with hands as soft as clouds

help is fiction, pain is real
