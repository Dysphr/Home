<p>why are you here

<br><br>the sombre look of the soft room is as shrill as the floor moving from my eyes, quietly rippling away into void

<br><br>i ask again

<br><br>the walls breathe loudly the sound of silence as the soft room echos my cries through the deafening hum ever flowing through my ears

<br><br>why are you here

<br><br>the lonely mirror reflects back an empty chair on which i perch whilst my skin pulses from solitude

<br><br>i'm going crazy

<br><br>hope, joy & freedom speaks from above whilst the fluorescent lamp reaches out grasping violently with hands as soft as clouds

<br><br>help is fiction, pain is real</p>
